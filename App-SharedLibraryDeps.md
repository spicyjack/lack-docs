Shared library dependency tool
- Gets a list of library dependencies for a given library file
- (Optional) gets the name of the package the linked-to library came from
  (if any)
- (Optional) Can use a kernel filelist instead of the system for verifying
  that required files are present in order to satisfy library dependencies
